# Renan Oliveira
### Hi there 👋! Welcome here!

</br>

I'm a grate enthusiast of the best frontend & backend development technologies.

I am a persistent and obstinate student. My main goal is to be in constant evolution!

</br>

Currently I have been working on projects involving Javascript, React and NextJs. In my free time I try to study and update myself in technologies for web development and English besides obviously enjoying the moment with my family because I am also a child of God 😅.

</br>

## In Short!

</br>

- 🔭 I’m currently working remotly at Marlin/RJ as a frontend developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying English, advanced javascript knowledge, Node, ReactJS and NextJS.
